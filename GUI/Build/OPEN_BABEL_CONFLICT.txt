openbabel python bindings from unnoficial windows python binaries conflicts with any open babel installation
this is due to BABEL_DATADIR variable being in the environment variables, the unnoficial binary version has no variable and use the
directory it's installed into as default, while the installable .exe one writes in environemnt variables and therefore changes the 
behaviour of all obabel.exe in the system, hence most formats will not work if it's there.

To fix this behaviour:

#import environ
from os import environ

#check if "BABEL_DATADIR" exists, and delete it from runtime if it does

if("BABEL_DATADIR" in environ):
   del environ["BABEL_DATADIR"]
